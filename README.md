# Marguerite

Marguerite is an iOS app that makes it easier for riders to use the free [Stanford Marguerite shuttle bus system](http://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite/). Previous versions of the app are located [here](https://github.com/cardinaldevs/marguerite-ios).

### Features
* See what buses are arriving next at the Marguerite stop closest to your current location.
* View the real-time locations of all shuttles.

### Notices

* You will need to modifiy the secrets file for some features to work. Email margueriteprojectmaintainer [at] gmail [dot] com for the keys.
* Built with Xcode 6.4
